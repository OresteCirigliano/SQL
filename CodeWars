#1 Hello SQL!
Return a table with a single column named Greeting with the phrase 'hello world!'
Please use Data Manipulation Language and not Data Definition Language to solve this Kata

-- write your select statement to return hello world

CREATE TABLE t1 (
  Greeting VARCHAR (255) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO t1 (Greeting) 
VALUES 
  ('hello world!');
select 
  Greeting as "Greeting" 
from 
  t1;
  
#2  SQL Basics: Simple IN

-- DESCRIPTION:
For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars.

departments table schema
id
name
sales table schema
id
department_id (department foreign key)
name
price
card_name
card_number
transaction_date
resultant table schema
id
name
NOTE: sometimes a department will not not contain a sale over $98 so just resubmit.

SELECT 
  id, 
  name 
FROM 
  departments 
WHERE 
  id IN (
    select 
      department_id 
    from 
      sales 
    where 
      price >= 98.00
  );
